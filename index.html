<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>

<p>I'm currently a User Experience Design student at General Assembly in San Francisco. What makes me a unique UX Designer is my background as a senior journalist for publications like The NY Times and CNN. I bring to the table expert skills of interviewing, researching, translating the ideas of many people into one cohesive story, reaching a diverse audience, and selling it. To be an effective UX leader, you also have to be a great communicator, manager, and visionary. </p>

<p>I come to UX as an information specialist. Recently, I have been doing PR for International AIDS Society; writing a book, "The Art of Celebrating," Vendome Press (October 25, 2016); and serving as communications director for Van Jones, CNN correspondent. I have written for the New York Times and regularly contributed to the SF Chronicle. I've also been doing PR for a Bay Area startup, MigFit, about Neuroplasticity. I've done so many interesting projects in my career, from interviewing Martin Scorsese to going undercover in disguise for exposés to writing national cover stories as Online Editor of PC Magazine. I come from a long line of journalists--my grandparents were editors, and their son, the author Bill Bryson, is my uncle--so storytelling is in my blood.</p>

<strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>Redesign an underused site to create new social opportunities.
In our concept project for Hunter’s Point Shipyard Association (HPSA), which runs a colony of 300 artists, our UX team focused on two main goals: exposure of the artists’ work and ways to engage the artists and the public.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>

<p>The site has to be special in its own right to draw people to it. 
Our idea to address these goals is to redesign the HPSA Web site with:  </p>

<ul>
<li>A site that has current, compelling content, much of it from the artists themselves </li>
<li>Innovative ways for the artists and public to interact. </li>
</ul>
